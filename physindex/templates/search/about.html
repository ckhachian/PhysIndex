        We are a team of physics majors at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and we spend countless hours studying and doing homework from our textbooks. We understand the difficulties students face, whether it be at the high school or college level. PhysIndex was created with the intent to make your life easier. Our name was inspired by our constant use of the index of our physics textbook. We each have years of experience in this field of study. Our goal is to provide quick and simple information about equations and variables so that you can get back to solving problems. Physindex is currently in a beta phase, so the content currently present will be limited. We will constantly be adding more useful knowledge to the site. You can check the <a href="{% url 'beta' %}">beta page</a> for updates on the current scope of the project. Also, check out the <a href="{% url 'features' %}">features</a> of PhysIndex to see how it can help you, or <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact us</a> with any feedback you have.
