Nick,u,m,$\textrm{m}$,meter,"Historically defined as one ten-millionth of the distance between the North Pole and Paris, the modern meter is the length traveled by a light wave in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 seconds.",base,base,metre,1,,
Nick,u,kg,$\textrm{kg}$,kilogram,"Historically, a kilogram was defined as the mass of one cubic liter of water. The mass of a kilogram today is defined as the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder internationally agreed-upon to be one kilogram.",base,base,,1,,
Nick,u,s,$\textrm{s}$,second,"The second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 vibrations of radiation of a certain cesium atom. On a less formal level, we think of a second as 1/60th of a minute, 1/3600 of an hour, etc.",base,base,,1,,

Charlie,v,F,$\vec{F}$,Force,"Any Influence that causes an object to undergo a certain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrcial construction. A force can cause an object with mass to change velocity, deform, or both. Force can intuitively be thought of as a push or a pull. A force has both a magnitude and a direction making it a vectore quantity.",Mechanics,,Newton,$ \textrm{N} $,1,42
Nick,v,m,$\textrm{m}$,Mass,"Mass is an intrinsic property of matter. If something exists and occupies a volume, it has mass. Unlike weight, mass is independent of gravity. If you weighed yourself on Earth and again on the Moon, you would notice a large decrease in your weight, because the Moon has a much weaker gravitational pull, but your mass would remain unchanged.",All,"kg,g,lb,weight",kilogram,$ \textrm{kg} $,1,

Nick,e,F=ma,$ \sum{ \vec{F} } = \frac{d \vec{p} }{dt} = m \frac{d \vec{v} }{dt} = m\vec{a} $,Newton's Second Law,"Newton's Second Law states that the vector sum of the forces on an object is equal to the total mass of that object multiplied by the acceleration of the object. In more technical terms, the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as, the net force acting on the body, and inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object and a is the acceleration of the object. Force and acceleration are both vectors. This means that they have both a magnitude (size) and a direction relative to some reference frame.",Mechanics,"force,f,Newton's second law","force,mass,acceleration",1,47,
