Jon,v,F,$\vec{F}$,force,"Any influence that causes an object to undergo a certain change, either concerning its movement, direction, or geometrical construction. A force can cause an object with mass to change velocity, deform an object, or both. Force can intuitively be thought of as a push or a pull. A force has both a magnitude and a direction making it a vector quantity.",Mechanics,none,newton,N,,
Jon,v,m,$m$,mass,"It is an intrinsic property of matter. If something exists and occupies a volume, it has mass. Unlike weight, mass is independent of gravity. If you weighed yourself on Earth and on the Moon, you would notice a large decrease in your weight, because the Moon has a much lower gravitational pull, but your mass would remain unchanged.",Mechanics,none,kilogram,kg,,
Jon,v,a,$\vec{a}$,acceleration,Acceleration is the rate at which the velocity of a body changes with respect to time. Acceleration is caused by a net force.,Mechanics,deceleration,"meter,second",$\frac{m}{s^2}$,,
Jon,e,F=ma,$\vec{F}=m\vec{a}$,Newton's Second Law,"The acceleration of a body is directly proportional to, and in the same direction as, the net force acting on the body, and inversely proportional to its mass. Thus, F = ma, where F is the net force acting on the object, m is the mass of the object and a is the acceleration of the object.",Mechanics,"Newton's,2nd,law","force,mass,acceleration",,,
