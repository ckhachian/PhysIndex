Charlie,e,F_grav = -(Gm1m2)/(r^2),$ \vec{F}_G = -G \frac{ m_1 m_2 }{ \vec{ r } ^2 } $,Newton's Law of Gravitation,Gravitation is the force that acts between bodies due to only their masses and is one of the four basic forces of physics. The negative sign is traditionally used to denote that it is an attracive force.,Mechanics,"Fg,Force","gravitational force,mass,radius",1,300,
Charlie,e,U_g = -(Gm1m2)/(r),$ U_G = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r} $,Gravitational Potential,"The potential energy is a property of a system of two particles $m_1$ and $m_2$, rather than of either body alone. The potential energy changes whether $m_1$ or $m_2$ is displaced. Each is acted upon by the gravitational force of the other.",Mechanics,"U,Ug","gravitational potential energy,mass,radius",,,
Charlie,e,F=(kq1q2/(r^2)),$ \vec{F}_E = \frac{ K q1 q2 }{ r^2 } $,Definition of Coulomb Force,"Here $F$ is the magnitude of the mutual force that acts on each of the two charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ and $r$ is the distance between their centers. As required by Newton's third law, the force exerted by $q_1$ on $q_2$ is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the force exerted by $q_2$ on $q_1$, even though the magnitudes of the charges may be different.",Electricity and Magnetism,electric force,"electric force,pi,electric constant (permittivity),electric charge,radius",2,573,Coulomb Force
Charlie,e,E=F/q,$ \vec{E} = \frac{ \vec{F} }{q} $,Electric Field,"Dimensionally, the electric field is the force per unit charge, and its SI unit is the newton/coulomb (N/C) although it is also often given in the unit of volt/meter (V/m). Note the similarity with the gravitational field. Both the gravitational and electric fields can be expressed as a force divided by a property (mass or charge) of the test body.",electricity and Magnetism,efield,"electric field,force,electric charge",,,
Nick,e,F_n = mg,$ \vec{F}_n = m \vec{ g } \cos{\theta} $,Normal Force,"The normal force is the counteracting force of a surface on an object. For example, as a book rests on a table, gravity exerts a downward force on the table proprortional to the mass of the book. In accord with Newton's Third Law, because the book does not fall through the table, there must then be a force equal in magnitude in the opposite direction of the gravitational force. This is ""normal"", or perpendicular, to the surface, hence the name ""normal force"".",mechanics,"Fn,Fnormal,mg,mgcostheta","normal force,mass,gravitational acceleration,angle",1,92-93,

When a particle moves in a circular path at constant speed, several forces may act upon it. The resultant of those forces must point toward the center of the circle, and we call the resultant of these forces the centripetal force.",mechanics,"F_c,Fc,centrifugal force,centripital force","centripetal force,mass,centripetal acceleration",1,100,Centripetal Force
Nick,e,r_cm,$ \vec{r}_{cm} = \frac{ m_1\vec{r}_1 + m_2\vec{r}_2 }{ m_1 + m_2 } $,Center of Mass,"The center of mass of an object or system is the point at which the mass on each side of it is balanced. For example, a barbell with equal weight on each side would have a center of mass exactly at the center, but adding weight to one side would move the center of mass in that direction. The center of mass of many-body systems can be calculated in this way as well.",mechanics,,"mass,radius",1,141,

Nick,e,p = qd,$ p = qd $,Electric Dipole Moment,The configuration of two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance is called an electric dipole. The magnitude  of the charge q on each of the components and their separation d often occur together as the product qd. It is convient to dfine this quantity as the electric dipole moment p.,electricity and Magnetism,,electric dipole moment,2,591,
Nick,e,q = ne,$ q = ne $,Electric Charge,"Electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when close to other electrically charged matter. There are two types of electric charges: positive (+) and negative (-). Positively charged substances are repelled from other positively charged substances, but attracted to negatively charged substances. Negatively charged substances are repelled from negative and attracted to positive. An object will be negatively charged if it has an excess of electrons, and will otherwise be positively charged or uncharged. The SI derived unit of electric charge is the coulomb (C), although in electrical engineering it is also common to use the ampere-hour (Ah), and in chemistry it is common to use the elementary charge (e) times an integer ($n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$) as a unit. The symbol Q is often used to denote a charge.",electricity and Magnetism,amount of electricity,electric charge,2,570,
