PhysIndex
====

PhysIndex is a web database of physics variables, equations, and their relationships. It is designed to quickly find articles about the correct equations and variables based on minimal queries, even if the search is for a single letter. It also provides a list of all other relevant articles and links thereto.

It is live at [physindex.com]

PhysIndex is now a static webpage - deploy it anywhere.

Of course, this means that the new PhysIndex is far less extensible than the old one. I made this transition because I thought some might find it helpful if the website was still alive. I do not intend to continue work on this project, but if PhysIndex were to become the ultimate database of physics equations, it would need an actual database system, and a platform in place to make it easier to add new data. The original version of the website had these features, but the technology is too out of date to work with today without a significant overhaul. If you would like to work on the original PhysIndex codebase, check out the "legacy" branch.
